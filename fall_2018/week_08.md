## Last Week's Accomplishments

Figured out that I either need to animate a drop down menu or I use html/js.

## This Week's Plan

Implement location navigation on front page that includes
slideshow navigation as well as drop down search navigation.

## Anything Blocking?

See notes

## Notes
I was thinking about how to implement a drop down system to choose places
on the homepage to view. This would require animation on the Aframe
entity and would end up being bulking since it would be
overlaid on top of the image. Then I thought about having a
bar with arrows to change the image of the place. This would not
support searching for a specific place to see. In the end I
am starting to research how vue.js and aframe can interact
to see if I can get a way to implement both, navigation bar in aframe
and a drop down in html/js.
