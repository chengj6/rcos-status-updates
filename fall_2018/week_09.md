## Last Week's Accomplishments

Finished implementing HUD location identifier.

## This Week's Plan

Add functionality to change the location on the home page

## Anything Blocking?

I do not know how Aframe interacts with normal JS.

## Notes
I may need to add an underlying queue to loop through so
I can add arrows to the sides of the location id so the user
can navigate through the locations.
Then I would need to add JS to loop through and change the Aframe scene
to the correct picture of the place.
