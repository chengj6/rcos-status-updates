## Last Week's Accomplishments

Implemented image navigation on home page

## This Week's Plan

Use drop down list to navigate rather than overlaying images to click to change image.

## Anything Blocking?

Aframe and JS interaction from action listener for the drop down and the 3d image on screen.

## Notes

May not need drop down to navigate images and just have slideshow display background on homepage
and have the images/navigation on another page.
