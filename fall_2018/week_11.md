## Last Week's Accomplishments

Still trouble shooting view change implementation.

## This Week's Plan

Add script code to give arrow keys functionality to change the view on the landing page.

## Anything Blocking?

I do not know how Aframe interacts with normal JS.

## Notes
I'm still trying to implement the arrows on the landing page. However, I could not get the script and Aframe entities to interact correctly. Moreover, I could not find a way to implement cursor listeners to the Aframe entities. As a result I began to implement a key listener for arrow keys to change the view. Unfortunately, I could not get the script and Aframe entities to interact correctly and did not have enough time to trouble shoot.
I had previously implemented an overlay to change the image, but adding an overlay to the image itself would impede the view itself. As a result, I tried to find a way to change the image without covering it. Originally I was going to implement a dropdown in Aframe, but I could not figure it out. Then I tried going with arrow keys and ended with what I have now. I understand there hasn't been much change to the code itself over the past semester and that is partially due to me not wanting to commit unfinished changes to the code itself. I have run through many iterations and deemed it worthless to push to my page since they did not give me any progress. As it is the last day for commits, I have decided to push what I have, intermittent testing code, and give it this last update to explain why I have not been committing as much as others have. Hopefully, I can figure out a way to implement this plan in the future, but for now I will need to focus on finals first.
