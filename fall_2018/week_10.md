## Last Week's Accomplishments

## This Week's Plan

Add script code to give arrow keys functionality.

## Anything Blocking?

I do not know how Aframe interacts with normal JS.

## Notes
I was originally planning to have arrows on the screen the user
could click to navigate between the images. But I could not find
a way to add an aframe entity that could be clicked by the cursor.
So now I am adding an event listener to every entity so that it
can use arrow keys to change the image.
