## Last Week's Accomplishments

Got Committing working so now I can see/publish my commits to my fork.

## This Week's Plan

Implement overlaying drop down menu for all locations (still).

## Anything Blocking?

Aframe image may not support actions like a drop down list

## Notes

May not need drop down to navigate images and just have slideshow display background on homepage
and have the images/navigation on another page.
